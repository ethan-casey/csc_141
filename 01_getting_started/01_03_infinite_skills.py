''' My infinite skills are these:

I do not have much, if any, experiance coding other than basic programming for lego robots and very basic games for children
I would like to learn more skills so I can become a good game designer. It would also be cool if I learned like hacking skills.

My dream is to create a game, mainly an rpg, turn based game, and an open world game that can inspire people to be heroes themselves
