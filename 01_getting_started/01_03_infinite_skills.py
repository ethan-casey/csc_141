''' My infinite skills are these:

I do not have much, if any, experiance coding other than basic programming for lego robots and very basic games for children
I would like to learn more skills so I can become a good game designer. It would also be cool if I learned like hacking skills.

My dream is to create a game, mainly an rpg, turn based game, and an open world game that can inspire people to be heroes themselves

It amazes me to see the different ways python is used. From just making basic websites, to use in the medical field, and of course
being used to make games. I truly wanna learn and be able to do just about anything there is involving coding, like website building.
